# Nanodegree-Intro-to-Programming

6 PARTS, 4 PROJECTS
1. Learn to Code

Welcome to the Introduction to Programming Nanodegree program. This is your first step on your journey to become a programmer. Get started early with html and feedback from our reviewers!

2. Make a Stylish Website
For the project, you'll use HTML and CSS to make a stylish web page on any topic. You will apply your knowledge of HTML Document Structure to your html file and then create custom CSS styling based on your personal preferences.

3. Code Your Own Quiz
You will use the Python programming language to build your own quiz. You will use a fill-in-the blank style to create a quiz that can even be used as a study tool to help you remember important vocabulary.

4. Create a Movie Website
You will write code to store a list of your favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. You will then use your code to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailer.

5. Discover Your Path
In this section, there is no project submission. Instead, you will explore a quick overview of the vast world of programming. After this section, you'll have a better understanding of different options you have as a programmer. This will help guide you in your final project for this program.

6. Choose Your Path
Choose one of the five paths (Front-End, Back-End, Android, Data Analyst, or iOS) and complete the associated course and project of your choosing. After you have met specifications on one of these project options (as well as the other required projects), you'll be eligible to graduate.
